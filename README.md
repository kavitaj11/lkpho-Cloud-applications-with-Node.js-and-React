Developing Back-End Apps with Node.js and Express

Module 1: 
Backend technologies include various types of servers and supporting infrastructures such as programming languages, frameworks, and other hardware.  
Node.js is the server-side component of JavaScript. 
The require statement can be called from anywhere in the app code, is bound dynamically, and is synchronous. The import statement must be called at the beginning of a file, is bound statically, and is not asynchronous.
Client-side JavaScript is used to process front-end user interface elements, and server-side JavaScript is used to enable access to different kinds of servers and web applications. 
With server-side JavaScript, Node.js applications process and route web service requests from the client. 
To make a function or a value available to Node.js applications that import your module, add a property to the implicit exports object. 
Core modules include bare minimum functionality, local modules are those that you create for your application, and the Node.js community creates third-party modules.
A local install means only the application within the directory of the installed can access the package, whereas a global install means that any application on the machine can access the package. 

Module 2:
Asynchronous network operations can be handled using callback functions in order to prevent blocking JavaScript code  
A callback function must invoke another callback function to pass a message from the Node.js module back to the main application after the Node.js module receives a response message 
Nested callbacks can be difficult to read and debug. Inversion of control causes trust issues when dealing with third-party code 
Promise objects are most useful for operations that are time-consuming and can block resources 
JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify() are two methods used to parse JSON objects
